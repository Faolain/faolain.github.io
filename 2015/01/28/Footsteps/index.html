<p>When one talks about finding the root of one’s inspirations or influences it is because one wishes to heuristically find the origins of direction. Some are content to leave the windings of their future trails up to the whims of a fickle fate, while others instead march forth under the banner of rational progressions, towards a set of concrete markers and goals. I have found myself torn between a desire for prodigal wanderlust while paradoxically anchoring my doubts in the port of sisyphean dialectics. What does this have to do with code? Nothing.</p>
<p>Coding, like the previous pseudointellectual ramblings, can be so simple or as complex that even a master philologist would find great difficulty in deciphering meaning. It is a means of expression in both style and content. It allows one to wield a virtual pen and illustrate in binary prose the synaptic maelstrom of thought. Growing up I was always technically “inclined” and found that the solutions to most problems could be mostly solved through the application of simple logical thought to seemingly amorphous and complex issues. Simultaneously I was always interested in expressing my thoughts through writing, coding just so happens to fit the bill on both accounts.</p>
<p>As can be seen in my writing I don’t have a clear answer to the question because it essentially asks what influenced or inspired you to learn another way to express yourself. Through code you can solve almost every single issue plaguing man today, hyperbole I know but when you have a hammer every problem becomes a nail. Through ever increasing data collection we are beginning to quantify every possible aspect of the planet ranging from climate models to cellular metabolic processes, through the use of code, we can begin to make sense of this data and derive conclusions which can better the collective lives of humanity. A noble aspiration but something that is only possible through code due to the increasing digitization of society. I have always wanted to give back to society, which led me to civil engineering as an undergrad in Coooper Union which taught not only the ethos of discipline and hardwork, but the importance of giving back the knowledge that was imparted unto you(Cooper Union tuition was free at the time of my attendance, something I will forever be grateful for) There are so many resources available to save time or generally make our lives better but due to information overload engendered by each notification sapping every last precious drip of attention we become paralyzed and let the digitization of our lives take away our time instead of give us more of the only truly non renewable resource that exists.</p>
<p>Coding is an attempt to draw the world and make it more beautiful, in each of our own perspectives of course. As the world becomes increasingly automated the ability to code will only become more important. The “internet of things” which is proposed to revolutionize our lives from knowing when to set the temperature of house to monitoring your heartrate will all require the coding equivalent of Pulitzer Prize winners to catapult us into a new age of thinking and seeing the world. No longer are coders confined to cubicles in back offices but visionaries with the power to alter the virtual and physical landscapes. Nineteenth century “rags to riches” Horatio Alger stories were the backbone of the American dream, and I believe the Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and co. will become the basis of a new dream where access to a computer can be the singular catalyst towards the betterment of society. Idealism aside, the rise or theoretical rise of Artificial Intelligence deeply intrigues me along with Ray Kurzweil’s “Singularity” and I have always been interested in Machine/Deep Learning, neural nets, linguistic analysis, etc… I want to become part of this and contribute as much as I can towards technological development while being able to work on sideprojects</p>
<p>So to answer the question if you believe it hasn’t been answered above</p>
<h5 id="TL;DR:_Want_to_get_rich/change_the_world(for_the_better)/bring_forth_all_the_ideas_that_have_been_ruminating_in_my_mind_onto_the_canvas_of_technology_and_make_Sci-Fi_Reality">TL;DR: Want to get rich/change the world(for the better)/bring forth all the ideas that have been ruminating in my mind onto the canvas of technology and make Sci-Fi Reality</h5>
<p>This was more of a brainstorm but I prefer this than to a highly refined cookie cutter presentation of post processed linear thoughts as this is more genuine and can guide you along different paths in your own search for “direction”.</p>
